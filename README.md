# Custom C++ & CUDA Machine Learning Library

A personal project from high school aimed to understand CUDA kernels and Neural Networks.

This is implemented in C++ and features a Matrix library supporting both CPU and GPU operations.
This library was then used as a backend for training multi layer perceptron networks. As well as Convolutional Neural Networks (At a later date)

The [GPU CUDA code](https://github.com/William-Baker/MLib/blob/main/GPUMatrix.cu) is the most interesting.

This library was then used in my first ever dissertation on the "Detection of Parkinson's within mouse data"
